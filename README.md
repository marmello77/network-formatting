(A) How to run the script:

1. Your network must be formatted as in the attached examples, being saved in TXT or XLSX format. Even the column headings should match the example headings.

1. After downloading these files, copy them to a separate folder in which to run the analyses.

2. Open RStudio. Load the "reshape2" and "xlsx" packages. If you do not already have them, install them:

Library (reshape2)
Library (xlsx)

3. Create a new script window (CMD + SHFT + N).

4. Define the working directory. Enter the path of the folder where the files in this script are:

Setwd ("write the complete folder path here")

5. Call the script file R, which is formatted as a function, using the source command:

Source ("network formatting.R")

6. Use the "inputs" function to run the network formatting script. Include the full path of the folder and the file type where you created the list of interactions; Can be ".txt" or "xlsx":

Inputs ("write the complete folder path here", files_type = ".txt")

7. Ready! Subfolders have been created in your working directory, with your network formatted for multiple programs.

(B) Details about this script for advanced users:

This script has only one function: "inputs". This function has two arguments: "dir" and "files_type"

Dir: defines where the interaction lists are to be transformed into the input files
Files_type: defines which format the lists are in, ".txt" or ".xlsx". Default is ".txt"

The required packages are: "reshape2" and "xlsx". Be sure to install them!


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(C) Advanced Instructions:

Interaction lists should follow the examples ("example.txt" and "example.xlsx"), both in formatting and column names. The names of the columns in the interaction lists should be: PARTNER_1, PARTNER_2, and WEIGHT. If the lists are in the ".txt" format, be sure to save them as a "tab-separated" file.

This script will run for all spreadsheets - in excel (.xlsx) or txt (.txt) format depending on what has been defined in "files_type" - inside the folder indicated in "dir". So be sure to (i) put in this folder only files you want to use, and (ii) all of them are structured as in the examples.
Only files saved in newer versions of excel (.xlsx format) will be read.

The "xlsx" package needs newer versions of Java to run, and any Java-related error when running this script is probably related to this. If you can not rotate in this format, choose to save the lists of interactions in tab separated format .txt and use files_type = ". Txt".
